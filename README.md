# DDFilm

DDFilm is a web application that allows users to watch and rate movies together in real time. The platform enables the creation of viewing groups where each user can start a session, add movies, and provide ratings. Movies for viewing are selected randomly based on a custom algorithm, and all session data is stored in a database to maintain a history of watched films even after a session has ended.
